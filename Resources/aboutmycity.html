	<h1>QuakeAware: My City</h1>
	<p>
		This section of the application maintains important emergency information that is specific to the city you live in.  
		At the moment we have only had the chance to add a few cities around where we live on the beautiful coast of British Columbia, Canada. We are working on adding additional cities and working with authorities in these cities to ensure that we can provide useful localized information.  If you keep this application on your phone, you will be notified when we push out updates. 	
		
	</p>
	<p>
		If you live elsewhere, you can use the 'Record Personal Notes' feature to enter in some information that will be stored for when you need it. This might be a location that your family has agreed ahead of time to be a meeting place if your home is not safe. 
	<p>
		If you would like us to include information on other cities in this application, feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@quakeaware.org">info@quakeaware.org</a>.
