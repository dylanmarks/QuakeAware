<h2>
	Tips</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		If you have access to an automated external defibrillator (AED), turn on the AED the moment it arrives and follow the instructions.</li>
	<li>
		Attach the electro pads to the victim bare skin (shaving might required). &nbsp;Please follow the diagram(s) provided with the AED for the proper pad placement location. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
	<li>
		Chest compressions are extremely important. If you are not comfortable giving rescue breaths, still perform chest compressions!</li>
	<li>
		It&#39;s normal to feel pops and snaps when you first begin chest compressions - DON&#39;T STOP! You aren&#39;t going to make the victim any worse. Cardiac arrest is as bad as it gets.</li>
	<li>
		When performing chest compressions, do not let your hands bounce. Let the chest fully recoil, but keep the heel of your hand in contact with the sternum at all times.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
	<li>
		While waiting for the ambulance, make it easy for them when they arrive:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Gather the victim&#39;s personal medical information.</li>
			<li>
				Send someone to meet the emergency crew and guide them to the victim.</li>
			<li>
				Move obstructions out of the way.</li>
			<li>
				Illuminate the area (if possible).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
