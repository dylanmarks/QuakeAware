<h2>
	ABCs</h2>
<p>
	If you come across an unconscious or semi-conscious victim:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Assess the environment - is it safe to proceed?
		<ul>
			<li>
				Fire, Wire, Glass, Grass, Gas and bodily fluids</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Assess the victim&#39;s responsiveness. If unresponsive or incoherent, call emergency services immediately.</li>
	<li>
		A for Airway - does the victim have an unobstructed airway?
		<ul>
			<li>
				If the victim is conscious, ask him or her to speak &ndash; &ldquo;Can you tell me your name?&rdquo;</li>
			<li>
				If the victim is unresponsive, open the victim&#39;s airway using the head-tilt, chin-lift method.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		B for Breathing - is the person breathing?
		<ul>
			<li>
				Put your ear close to the victim&#39;s mouth and listen for breathing. Look at the chest or abdomen if it rises with each breath. &nbsp;Check for 10 seconds.</li>
			<li>
				If the victim is breathing normally, place him or her in the recovery position, a 10-second check should be repeated every 2 minutes.</li>
			<li>
				With irregular breathing, it is recommended that a 10-second check to be performed every minute as the victim&rsquo;s condition could change and CPR might be required.</li>
			<li>
				If you do not see, hear, or feel normal breathing &ndash; attempt to push TWO full breaths (look for a rising chest) in the person by using a pocket mask follow by CPR. (Pocket masks should be used for protection from bodily fluids)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		C for Circulations or Compressions
		<ul>
			<li>
				Landmarking &ndash; from the top of the armpits, find the middle point on the chest, and place the heel of your hand in the middle of the victim&#39;s chest. Put your other hand on top of the first with your fingers interlaced.</li>
			<li>
				Compression depth - Compress the chest about 1-1/2 to 2 inches (4-5 cm). Allow the chest to completely recoil before the next compression.</li>
			<li>
				Compress the chest at a rate equal to 100/minute. &nbsp;Perform 30 compressions at roughly 2 compressions per second.</li>
			<li>
				Open the airway with head-tilt and perform (PUSH) 2 rescue breaths.</li>
			<li>
				Continue to perform 30 compressions with 2 breaths.</li>
			<li>
				Keep going until help arrives.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
